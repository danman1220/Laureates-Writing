\section{Abstract}
Multiple-hour long observations of single pulsars allow us to probe relatively
high-frequency regions of the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum typically outside
the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array (PTA). Using such single pulsar
observations from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
Waves (NANOGrav), we applied known techniques for seeking single-source continuous
wave (CW) sources. By analyzing simulated data with an injected source, we
verified the accuracy of the CW search method for hours-long data sets.
Furthermore, by applying an identical analysis to the true data, we found that
the data places new upper limits on GW strain in the high frequency regime.

\section{Introduction}
The search for low frequency gravitational waves in the universe is currently
best carried out using Pulsar Timing Arrays. The incredible precision timing of
pulsars, along with their relative abundance in the universe, make the PTA a
high precision gravitational wave detection instrument with the ability to probe
a large range of the gravitational wave parameter space.
\\
The sensitivity of the PTA is due to two factors: the natural precision of
millisecond pulsars, and the self-correcting nature of the timing model used to
model pulsar behavior. Both of these aspects of the PTA will be covered in more
detail in the next section.
\\
The high fidelity of the PTA stems mainly from the fact that there is an
abundance of pulsars in the galaxy with many different placements in the sky.
Each line of sight to a pulsar provides data on the strength of the
gravitational wave passing across the line of sight. Furthermore, each pair of
pulsars provides correlation data that can give information on the direction and
overall magnitude of the gravitational wave. This is because each line of sight
gives information analagous to the projection of the wave onto the line of
sight. Thus, to ascertain a two-dimensional signal source position, at least two
lines of sight are needed. Furthermore, with additional lines of sight,
correlation restrictions can be put on the data to add to the confidence of a
detection.
\\
For example, if the data from two lines of sight suggested a source location
at some coordinates $(\theta,\phi)$, one would expect any other set of two lines of
sight to yield the same result. If a second set of lines of sight confirmed that
the source location was at coordinates $(\theta,\phi)$, that would add to the
confidence of the detection. However, if another line of sight were to predict
different coordinates, that would suggest that the $(\theta, \phi)$ detection in
the first pair of pulsars is more likely to be a false positive.
\\
With so many lines of sight, many interesting properties of gravitational waves
can be probed, including precise measurements of the location of the source, as
well as the strain of the gravitational wave itself. However, the hallmark of
such a detector is the ability to detect the stochastic background of
gravitational waves. This is described in further detail in the next section.

\section{Background}
The goal of this section is to provide a comprehensive background of the theory
and techniques used in gravitational wave pulsar astrophysics.
\\
It is necessary, then, to first understand what a pulsar is. When a large star
reaches the end of its life cycle, it has the potential to go supernova. This
occurs when the core of the star runs out of material to fuse, and the fusion
reactions begin to slow down. As the rate of fusion decreases, the outward
pressure caused by the fusion also decreases. There reaches a point, then, when
the pressure due to fusion does not balance the gravitational pressure of the
star. At that point, the star collapses on itself in a catastrophic event.
After such an event, there are a few possibilities for the outcome of the core
remnants of the star. If the gravitational pressure is enough to force the core
past its Scwarzshield radius, the core will collapse into a black hole. On the
other hand, if the gravitational pressure is relatively weak, the core will
remain relatively undisturbed, and will become a white dwarf star. In the
intermediary range between these two possibilities lies a third one; if the
gravitational pressure is just barely not enough to force the core into a black
hole state, it will instead force the formation of a neutron star.
Neutron stars are the most extreme objects in the universe. With such intense
gravitational pressure forming them, high-energy nuclear processes occur in the
atoms that formed the core of the original star. As protons and electrons are
pushed together, it becomes energetically favorable for the electrons to undergo
reverse beta decay, and fuse into neutrons. With no electrostatic repulsion
between the protons and electrons, the core mass--which is almost all neutrons
at this point--can collapse further on itself, achieving a density similar to
that of an atomic nucleus. At this point, the core mass has reached a stable
configuration, and is now a neutron star. More than an entire solar mass of core
material forms the star, which is spherical with a diameter of about 10km.
\\
After the formation of the neutron star, there is a possibility that the star
will be "spun up" to high angular speeds. If the star was in a binary system,
it may accrete material from its companion, and take some angular momentum from
it. Since the neutron star is so small, a small change in angular momentum will
be magnified to a larger change in the angular velocity of the star.
\\
Another peculiar feature of neutron stars is their intense magnetic fields--up
to 1e8 times as much as the earth. For neutron stars that are spinning rapidly,
this magnetic field moves very rapidly through space, accelerating free
electrons and causing synchrotron radiation. The radiation is then forced out of
the poles of the magnetic fields in a beam formation. 
\\
A pulsar is exactly this sort of object--a rotating neutron star with beam
emissions of electromagnetic waves. Pulsars are particularly bright in radio
frequencies, which makes them best studied using radio telescopes. They have
very slow spin-down rates, so their periods are very stable in time.
As seen in the P-Pdot diagram, there exists a certain class of
pulsars with incredibly low periods and spin-down rates. These are known as the
millisecond pulsars, called such due to their extremely fast rotational periods.
With such amazing stability and cadence, millisecond pulsars function incredibly
well as stellar timekeepers--some rivaling even an atomic clock's precision. It
is this stability that makes millisecond pulsars the primary data source for
gravitational wave searches.

plotted against their spindown rates. Millisecond pulsars live in the bottom
left quadrant of the plot, and spin down very slowly.}

\end{figure}


A gravitational wave is a perturbation in spacetime caused by a rotating
quadropole somewhere in the universe. The most common sources of gravitational
waves are black hole binary systems, especially supermassive black hole binaries
that occur in galaxy collisions. Such binary systems emit sinusoidal
gravitational waves that give rise to the perturbation [GW equation].
This perturbation occurs in the local metric of the space, and represents a
change in the space-time intervals between objects. The co-ordinate distances
remain fixed, but the practical (read: light travel time) distance is perturbed
slightly.
\\
The LIGO detectors recently announced the first detection of gravitational
waves. They detected a strain $\frac{\delta L}{L} \approx 10^{-21}$, corresponding to an absolute
distance change on the order of a fraction of a proton diameter. The LIGO
observatory was able to detect such small changes in distance by using an
optimized interferometer. By splitting a laser along two orthogonal paths,
reflecting them back to each other, and observing the interference magnitude, an
interferometer is able to precisely measure miniscule changes in the
differential lengths of their arms. One way of conceptualizing the
interferometer is by following the crests of the laser across the device. The
crests are evenly spaced in the arm, and without loss of generality will
recombine constructively. However, imagine a change in the length of one of the
arms. Now, the crests along one arm have more distance to travel, and thus will
arrive delayed compared to their companions. Such a delay will induce a slightly
destructive interference in the resulting recombination beam, and will be
detectable by a light intensity detector. One can think of the stable arm as a
"reference beam", and the changing arm as the "detector beam". With this mode of
thinking, the interferometer acts as a comparison device between the reference
beam and the detector beam.
\\
In a way, pulsar timing functions the same way as interferometers do. The line
of sight between us and the pulsar functions as the detector beam, with the
pulses originating from the pulsar functioning as the crests. In order to get
the equivalent of a reference beam, it is necessary to develop a timing model
that describes with great precision the expected time of arrival of the pulse
from the pulsar. With such a timing model, it is possible to compare the
measured time of arrival and the expected time of arrival to gain information
about the distance changes on the line of sight of the pulsar.
\\
However, such a method requires an incredibly accurate timing model for the
pulsar that takes into account all known effects between the earth and the
pulsar. Such a model has been developed, and is used in the analysis pipeline to
accurately calculate the expected time of arrival of a pulse. The timing model
takes into account a wide array of effects. First and foremost, the timing model
requires a precise measurement of the period of the observed pulsar, as well as
the spindown rate, to model the pulse source accurately. Next, the timing model
takes into account the motion of the earth relative to the pulsar. The model
normalizes the times of arrival to the center of the solar system, and accounts
for the movement of the pulsar towards, away, or transverse to the solar system.
Next, the model takes into account any effects due to general relativity,
including the Shapiro delay effect for binary systems, and precession for
orbiting pulsars.
The ultimate goal of the timing model is to "zero out" any known effects between
us and the pulsar. After the timing model is made, any deviation we observe from
the timing model must be due to some unmodelled effect.
\\
At regular intervals, NANOGrav observes the 43 [?] pulsars that are in the
pulsar timing array. such observations allow comparisions to be made between the
expected times of arrival and the measured times of arrival. One use of these
observations is to improve the timing model for the pulsar. Deviations from the
timing model that follow known patterns due to incorrect timing model values can
give insight on how to improve the timing model parameters.
Thus, the timing model is "self-correcting" in the sense that
observations themselves improve the precision of the timing model.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Having an incorrect parameter in the model produces easily detectable
and correctable signatures in the residual data.}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./figures/bad_timing.png}
\end{figure}


However, there may be deviations from the timing model that do not correspond to
incorrect parameters. These deviations must necessarily, then, come from
unmodelled processes. Of the most importance is the deviation corresponding to a
sine-like change in the distance between us and the pulsar. Although there could
be many potential sources for such a perturbation, a likely candidate is a
gravitational wave between the earth and the pulsar. It is possible, however,
that such a sine-like signal corresponds to an unmodelled process in the timing
model. For example, if the pulsar were in a binary system that was not known
beforehand, it would appear as if the distance between us and the pulsar were
changing sinusoidally--because it actually is changing sinusoidally due to the
orbit of the pulsar around its companion! Many binary systems have been
discovered this way, long before the optical telescopes verify the existence of
the companion.
\\
To verify whether or not a sine-like signal corresponds to a gravitational wave,
the data is searched for a time correlation between pulsars. If the sine wave
shows up in multiple pulsars, then it can be concluded that the signal is not
originating from an unmodelled process in any individual pulsar. Such a
correlated signal must, then. correspond to some unmodelled process in the space
between all the pulsars in the galaxy. Using the relative locations of the
pulsars, specifics of the sine signal can be probed. Polarity and propagation
direction can be ascertained from the relative amplitudes of the signals in the
different pulsars in the pulsar timing array.

\section{Stochastic Detection}
While continuous wave sources are detectable by the PTA, the stochastic
background of gravitational waves is what the PTA is best tuned for. The
stochastic background of gravitational waves is the sum of all the gravitational
waves passing through our galaxy. Dominating the stochastic background is the
vast collection of graviational waves from supermassive black hole binaries.
Using the pulsar timing array, the properties of the stochastic background can
be probed. This is done by looking for correlated signals across the pulsars, in
an analysis similar to the continuous wave search method. By looking for these
correlated signals in the data, it is possible to ascertain the relative
abundance of the frequencies of waves that contribute to the background. This
data can be used, then, to look at the various proportions of black hole masses
and orbital frequencies in the universe. This gives information on galaxy
collision rates, as well as collision durations and galaxy black hole masses.

\section{High-Frequency Continuous Wave Detection}
    The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) is tuned to probe GW
frequencies in the months to years timescale. Observations of individual pulsars
are carried out on a biweekly basis, due to the large amount of pulsars needed
to be observed. With such infrequent observations, however, GW frequencies on
the
order of hours remain unexplored. This is due to the intrinsic limit on
detection set by the Nyquist frequency, defined as the maximum frequency
periodic signal that is detectable for a given sampling frequency. In order to
accurately sample a periodic signal, it is necessary to sample at least twice
per cycle to avoid introducing errors. Beyond
this frequency, the sampling rate is not enough to properly detect a sine wave
signal, and any such CW signal would appear as white noise in the data.
\\
    Recently, a 24 hour global observation was carried out on pulsar J1713+0747, which
resulted in a new set of limits on Continuous Wave (CW) strain in the days to
hours frequencies due to the average sampling rate of about 0.5 samples/min.
Limits were set for both CW sources in the direction of J1713, as well as
random-direction CW sources.
\\
  However, J1713 is not the only pulsar that has been observed for long,
continuous observations. The pulsars J2302 and J0613 were each observed for
multiple hours at a time, originally for the purpose of measuring the shapiro
delay effect for each of the pulsars. Such data sets allow for analysis similar
to that done to the J1713 24 hour campaign. These pulsars allow for better
direcitonal limits to be placed in the microhertz to millihertz frequency range.

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./figures/J2302_residuals.png}
\end{figure}

   In 2013, eight pulsars were observed for extended periods of time for the
initial purpose of observing NANOGrav pulsars with significant Shapiro delays,
targeted strategically in order to better observe the delays and therefore
improve timing models (Pennucci et al. 2015, Fonseca et al. 2016). 
Of the eight data sets, two were chosen for our
analysis. Both J2302+4442 and J0613-0200 had small rms residual values, and
long continuous timing tracks.  Each pulsar was observed three times over the
course of the full observation period.  For each pulsar, the longest single
observation track was selected for observation. J2302 was observed continuously
for over 8 hours, and J0613 was observed continuously for over three hours.
The residuals were generated using the tempo2 software, drawing its parameters
from NANOGrav's 9 year data release. The binary orbit periods of each pulsar
are of particular interest, as a binary period naturally weakens the
sensitivity of the pulsar to continuous wave sources of a similar frequency.
The binary period for pulsar J2302 is given as about 126 days, and the binary
period for pulsar J0613 is given as about 1.2 days.

of J0613-0200 and J2302+4442.}

\section{Data Analysis}
\subsection{Noise}
   For each pulsar, we developed a noise modelto account for any intrinsic or
extrinsic sources of noise in the data. The model included both white and red
noise estimations. Five parameters were varied: EFAC, EQUAD, Jitter-EQUAD,
RN-Amplitude, and RN-Spectral-Index. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method
for exploring parameter spaces, we found the maximum a posteriori values for
each parameter, and used them to construct the noise covariance matrix.
\\
The five parameters were chosen for a noise model that has been used in
previous analysis schemes. The EFAC parameter acts as a constant multiplier on
the TOA uncertainties. The EQUAD parameters represent additional Gaussian white
noise added to the EFAC noise. The RN-Amplitude and RN-Spectral-Index parameters
describe a red noise variance. 

\subsection{Detection Statistic}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\caption{The Fp statistic calculated from the residuals. The dashed line shows
the minimum Fp value needed to claim a detection with a false alarm probability
of 1e-4.}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./figures/both_fp.png}
\end{figure}

    Our main tool for analyzing the sensitivity of a pulsar to continuous wave
sources is the $F_p$ statistic, developed by Justin Ellis (Arzoumanian et. al
2014). The
$F_p$ statistic is a frequentist detection statistic. It can be thought of as a
measure of how much a particular frequency dominates the data. A high $F_p$
statistic is indicative of a potential CW source at that frequency. For each
potential CW frequency, we calculate the $F_p$ statistic for the data at that
frequency. Our detection threshold of about $F_p \geq 13$ corresponds to a false
alarm probability of $10^{-4}$.

\subsection{Upper Limits and Source Simulation}

After creating the noise model for the pulsar, we determine the sensitivity to
CW sources at different gravitational wave frequencies. On a high level, this
is done by simulating CW sources in random directions with a given strain, and
seeing if they can be detected with the given noise model. By ramping up the
simulated strain until a detection is made, we obtain the lowest detectable
strain--the strain limit--for that GW frequency. To determine whether or not a
specific strain can be detected, we simulate 5000 sources sequentially in
either random directions or, in the case of a directional search, in the
direction of the pulsar. Each source is simulated with a random inclination,
and a set distance to keep the strain amplitude constant. Then, for each
source, we create simulated residuals based on the CW source and the noise
model, and generate an$f_p$statistic. A source is labelled "detectable" if the
Fp statistic is higher than the actual data's$f_p$statistic. If more than 95\% of
the simulated sources are detectable, then it can be concluded that a CW source
with a strain equal to the fixed strain is detectable above the noise. Thus,
that strain is an upper bound on CW source strains for the particular GW
frequency being examined.

\section{Results}

\begin{figure}

as well as single-pulsar limits from J0437-0745 and B1937+21. Also plotted is

J2302+4442, and the previously published limit from J1713+0747.}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./figures/all_limits.png}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./figures/hf_limits.png}
\end{figure}

Applying the $f_p$ statistic algorithm to the two pulsars analyzed, we found
there was no evidence for a single source gravitational wave signal. However,
using the source simulation algorithm, we were able to place upper limits on the
strength of the gravitational waves passing through the galaxy at the
frequencies probed. Such limits were in coincidence with previously published
limits from pulsar J1713+0747. Furthermore, the results coincide with a
reasonable extrapolation of the results obtained by NANOGrav and the other PTA
consortia.

\section{Conclusion}
    Using our pipeline, we were able to recreate the omnidirecitonal and
directional limits from the J1713 24 hour global campaign, which verified the
integrity of our analysis algorithm. Using data from the Green Bank Telescope
taken to measure shapiro delay effects on PSR J0613-0200 and PSR J2302+4442, we
were able to place omnidirectional limits consistent with limits already placed
in that GW frequency range. 
    While these limit curves do add confidence to the current strain limit given
by analysis of J1713, further analysis will be able to place more strict
directional limits on CW strain amplitude in directions that have not been
probed before in this frequency range.
\\
    Further analysis will attempt to remove statistical fluctuations in the data
through using a greater amount of simulations. Furthermore, the noise model can
be improved upon by sampling the parameter space of the noise model more
precisely. Directional limits can be placed in the direction of both J2302 and
J0613. Also, similar analyses can be carried out on each of the other six
pulsars observed by the Green Bank Telescope in the shapiro delay project. For
each pulsar, strict directional limits on CW strain amplitude can be placed for
GW frequencies in the microhertz to millihertz range.
